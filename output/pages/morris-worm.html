<p>The Morris Worm was a self-replicating computer program (worm) written by Robert Tappan Morris. He was a student at Cornell University. He released the computer worm from one of the MIT’s computer on <em>November 2, 1988</em>.</p>
<p>According to Morris, the purpose of the worm was to gauge the size of the precursor “Internet” of the time – ARPANET – although it unintentionally caused denial-of-service (DoS) for around 10% of the 60,000 machines connected to ARPANET in 1988.
The worm spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in UNIX send mail, finger, and rsh/rexec as well as by guessing weak passwords. Yes, Unix was vulnerable too.</p>
<h3>How it worked?</h3>
<p>Before spreading to a new machine, the Morris Worm checked if the machine had already been infected and was running a Morris Worm process. If a target machine had already been infected, the Morris Worm would re-infect it 1 in 7 times. This practice of “1-in-7 re-infection” ensured that a user could not completely avoid a Morris Worm infection by creating a fake Morris Worm process to pretend his or her machine was already infected. It also, caused some users’ machines to be infected many times – once too many Morris Worm processes were running on a target machine it would run out of computing resources and begin to malfunction.</p>
<p>The United States vs Morris (1991) court case resulted in the first conviction under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, with Morris receiving a sentence of three years in prison, 400 hours of community service and a $10,000 fine. It was easy back then.</p>
<p>The floppy containing Source code of the Morris Worm is kept in a Computer History Museum, what an achievement, isn’t it?</p>

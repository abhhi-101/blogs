Hey everyone, in today‚Äôs blog we read some interesting phishing Stories. This is part of our ‚ÄúHuman hacking series‚Äù if you haven‚Äôt read previous blogs read it here.
So let‚Äôs begin‚Ä¶

Firstly, What is Phishing attack?
In layman words, Phishing is a type of Social Engineering attack often used to steal user data. Data may include login credentials and credit-card numbers, personal information, bank details etc.
Phishing occurs when the attacker use technique of Impersonation and manipulate the victim user to perform certain task, for more info on Impersonation attack visit.

Major sources of Phishing attacks are Emails (The kings tool), Instant message or Text messages.

I have been getting many such Phishing Text Messages recently, In below image you can see

When firstly I saw this Message, it looked Legit to me because I have a source of Income who pays me exact ‚Çπ3500 per month by paytm only. But as I am educated about such attacks, instead of Clicking the link I went to my paymt app and checked the passbook, I had no entry of any received amount. \0/
What would you have do if you would be at my place? let me know in comments below!

Unfortunately, many people around are unaware of Social Engineering attacks and how much they cause, this is very essential for us to educate yourself and people around us.

Let‚Äôs consider a scenario, you know what Phishing is and how it works, but your father or mother is unaware of such attacks. They got a mail saying they won a lottery and to withdraw they have to login with their Email on attackers page, they did because everything here looks legit, no scope for doubt. Attacker got control over their account and he mailed you with Phishing link from their Mail account, no matter how well prepared you are, you will 100 & 1 % open it and fall victim to attacker. Correct me if I am wrong.

We hear in news that YouTubers account got hacked, recently carryminati‚Äòs account was hacked.
How this might had happens, If I was an Attacker, I would create a website selling some product and mail carry with a link to my website saying I want him to do advertisement of my product on his channel, it is usual for YouTubers to get such advertisements offers so it is most likely that he will click the link provided, and as soon as he clicks the link, a malicious script would get executed on his computer and I will get a pwned shell on his system. In fraction of seconds, carry is Hacked.

We humans are eager to trust someone, and others are eager to break that trust. Never trust any piece of sh*t online. For more‚Ä¶

See you in next blog, till then be safe, have a nice day and babye!! üôÇ

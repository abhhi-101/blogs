Hey Everyone, I am gonna start a series of blog in which I will be sharing just the incident where the cyber attack was successful just because the employees or staff was not educated towards Human Hacking. We will call this as ‚ÄúHumans, the weakest in chain‚Äù, lets begin‚Ä¶

In today‚Äôs blog we are gonna talk about 'The Veteran Administration Breach'.

First things first, A veteran is a former member of the Armed Forces of the United States (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard) who served on active duty and was discharged under conditions, which were other than dishonorable. Persons who attended military academies are now considered veterans for financial aid purposes.

This took place in 2006, the veteran‚Äôs Affair administration had a regular security analyst which is yearly, this is really bad to undertake security check after 365 days as most dangerous attack might need few seconds to take place, at least every month is must. Most of the Security breaches on Governments sites becomes easy due to such negotiation.

The veteran‚Äôs Administration gave the permission to an Security Analyst to copy their entire data onto his laptop and allowed him to work from home. The data contained Millions of Social Security Numbers, their rating and other personal information also it was not Encrypted. Voila! Hackers saw this to be perfect time to get the data or stole the data from single person without any security from his home instead of stealing it from highly guarded place.

The next morning, when Analyst was looking for his laptop which contained all the data, he couldn‚Äôt find it, perhaps, it was stolen. It was later discovered that the data also contained of about 26.5 Million veterans along with Active Military personals and their Family members.

The impact of the theft was estimated to be between 100 Million to 500 Million Dollars üôÇ

Things to understand her:
```
1. Never let the Confidential Information go out of your Organization. If its out, it will find a way to get in wrong hands
2. Working from home is a Responsibility that we need to take care off. Its highly risky when we are dealing with such confidential data and working from home.
```

Humans are the Weakest link in Cyber Security chain.

We need to be extra careful since its our owns responsibility to increase our knowledge towards such scenarios.

See you in the next blog till that have a good and babye!!

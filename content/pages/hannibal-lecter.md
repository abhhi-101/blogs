Yes, it was brand new Porsche 🙂
As these offers are common in India too, we get coupons, tickets etc but brand new Porsche is one time opportunity

## Attack

The competition was to call at 102nd caller to win the prize, with his knowledge of telephone systems he easily hacked into calling system of KIIS-FM and placed a call and won it damm!!

Later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned about his trick, they pursued him and he went underground. He was later found, arrested, and went to prison for five years. He was the first American ever to be released from prison with a ban on the use of a computer for three years.

Now, he works as contributing editor with “The Daily Beast” and distanced himself from his past as a hacker.
Recently, he has done several investigation reports for social good.

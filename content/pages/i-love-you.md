This was a a computer worm that infected over ten million Windows personal computers on and after 4 May 2000 when it started spreading as an email message with the subject line “ILOVEYOU” and the attachment “LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.

Now a days PCs are smart and smart solutions are in place to protect us form such worms and viruses…. that’s all fake. The need is of just bypassing Firewalls that’s it, you simply can’t relay on Firewalls and Anti-viruses for your help. In hackers community we consider WAF(_Web App Firewalls_) are made so that we hackers can bypass it and get easy money 😉

## The Fix
Creator’s gonna create, Hacker’s gonna hack. But to be at safe side, we need to be aware before performing such actions. Only open mails that looks relevant to you, crosscheck it properly.
If it looks suspicious to you, don’t open it or open it in Virtual Environment such as Virtual Box or vmware.

<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>Viruses is the biggest enemy of Windows and No year went when No Windows PC had been victim of any Virus. 
For those who don‚Äôt know what Virus is?</p>
<p>Computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code &amp;&amp; Phishing is a cyber-crime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why I love you?</h3>
<p>Rather, why not?
Phishing is biggest tool of hacker to make victim fall for his web. More on it, the word ‚ÄúI Love You‚Äù hits your inbox, who would not fall for it?</p>
<p>In 2000 the following guy made a Virus called I Love You Virus.</p>
<p><img alt="creators" src="../images/creator.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<h2>Attack</h2>
<p>It is fairly simple to make such viruses in general. Just imagine, your mail box saying <strong>hey I love you, I have attached a Love Letter for U</strong> till what extend could you resist your self and not open it!!! as below -</p>
<p><img alt="creators" src="../images/i_love_you_virus_nerdeky.jpg"></p>
<p>This was a a computer worm that infected over ten million Windows personal computers on and after 4 May 2000 when it started spreading as an email message with the subject line ‚ÄúILOVEYOU‚Äù and the attachment ‚ÄúLOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.</p>
<p>Now a days PCs are smart and smart solutions are in place to protect us form such worms and viruses‚Ä¶. that‚Äôs all fake. The need is of just bypassing Firewalls that‚Äôs it, you simply can‚Äôt relay on Firewalls and Anti-viruses for your help. In hackers community we consider WAF(<em>Web App Firewalls</em>) are made so that we hackers can bypass it and get easy money üòâ</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Fix</h2>
<p>Creator‚Äôs gonna create, Hacker‚Äôs gonna hack. But to be at safe side, we need to be aware before performing such actions. Only open mails that looks relevant to you, crosscheck it properly.
If it looks suspicious to you, don‚Äôt open it or open it in Virtual Environment such as Virtual Box or vmware.</p>
<hr>
<p>That‚Äôs it for today‚Äôs blog, Due to requests I will be bloging about such hack stories daily üôÇ In next blog I am going to start Tutorials on Bugs, stay tuned. Till that have a good day and babye!!</p>

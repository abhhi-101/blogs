<p>Social Engineering bypasses all firewalls

<p>Hey everyone, in today‚Äôs blog we will talk about the worlds biggest and Greatest hacker of all time ‚ÄúMr Kevin Mitnick‚Äù.</p>
<p>Kevin hack for fun, even today. As a young boy, he was taught in high school that hacking was cool. He gained unauthorized access for the first time into a computer by hacking at the age of 16 in 1979 after a friend gave him the phone number for Ark, the system used by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). He was arrested for this in 1988 for 12 months and followed 3 years in a supervised release, but Mitnick hacked into another computer system before the supervised release ended and went into underground to hide from law enforcement.
He says ‚ÄúI hacked caused it was cool and fun as well, I had no other intention to hack‚Äù.</p>
<p>In order to hide, he used to use cloned cell phones for hiding his real location. In this time, he stole valuable software from the United States largest cell phone companies. He also read private e-mails of many people for fun. When he was arrested, he was found with more then 100 cell phones clone codes and several cloned cell phones along with false identification documents(typical hacker).</p>
<p><img alt="wanted mitnick" src="../images/marshal.jpeg"></p>
<p>He was sentenced for 5 years of prison. After 4 years and half, he was on trial and for rest of his sentence of eight months, he was kept in solitary confinement. This is was because few law enforcement officers told a judge that Kevin could whistle into a payphone and start a nuclear war _O_/</p>
<p>As all other x-black-hat, Kevin is also turned good guy and run a security firm called Mitnick Security Consulting, LLC and is Co-Owner of KnowBe4, a provider for a platform for simulated phishing testing and security awareness training. üôÇ</p>
<p>He has some amazing talk and interviews on YouTube, find it here</p>
<p>That‚Äôs all for today, see you next blog, till that have a good day and babye!!</p>

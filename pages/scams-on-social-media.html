<p>Hey Everyone in today’s blog I will open up about Scams that happens daily on Social Media like Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter etc</p>
<p>While browsing Instagram, at least once you might have seen this post</p>
<p><img alt="scam" src="../images/scam1.png"></p>
<p>These scam post are used to manipulate people by using our weakness and Money is our primary weakness. Most the time, people fall for it and lose their money. Many of my friends are victim of such scams and they lost about 6000 rupees each.</p>
<p>Here is what happened to one of my friend,
He saw this post on Instagram page which he follows, as being student, he thought it would be great if he could earn some extra cash instead of asking money from his parents.
He went to below page</p>
<p><img alt="scam" src="../images/scam2.png"></p>
<p>He saw page with 10K followers, also in Stories he saw many such Evidences living no scope for doubt</p>
<p><img alt="scam" src="../images/scam3.png"></p>
<p>When he messaged the person, he got the following response, asking for 1999 rupees to join without giving any explanation about what kind of job it is and what work they do.
Being in complete control over them, he paid them the amount.
And in response he was asked to pay more 3000 rupees in order to get some login id.
He felt something is wrong, still they were not leaking any information about what the job was. He was trapped, if he refused to pay the previous money was gone and he had no money to pay further.
Some how he managed to pay another 3000, but the real scam started here. They ignored him completely as soon as he paid the amount.</p>
<p>After two days of continuous messaging and requests, they responded him saying, “Your job is to open a Instagram page, buy few thousand followers and do the same as I am doing, manipulate people and take money from them, if they pays you tell them the same technique of scam“</p>
<p>As soon this happened, he messaged me, I filled a online complaint for FIR against him here. It was the case of Online fraud according to Information Technology Act Sections 66 and IPC 419 (cheating by personation) and 420 (cheating)</p>
<p>After filling the complaint, he sent the Screenshot of FIR to the scammer, he got scared and after few hours, scammer refunded the amount.</p>
<p>This might not happen with you if you are victim of such fraud case. My friend got lucky.
This scammer are allover Social Media.
They might manipulate you, everything looks so legit that you can’t even resist for once.</p>
<p>This blog was to inform you to be safe from such online scams. We are students and being students we only have to make Investment in our knowledge. This is the only best Investment we can make. Increasing our knowledge is the key to Success.</p>
<p>At last I would say first of all don’t be a victim online, but you think you are, you can contact me anytime I would be more then happy to help you be safe.</p>
<p>See you in next blog, till then have a nice day and babye!!</p>

<p>Hey Everyone, In todayâ€™s blog we will a attack that was caused due to Social Engineering Attack. This is 2 blog in this series, find first here.
So, letâ€™s beginâ€¦</p>
<h2>Title: Toyota BEC Scam</h2>
<p><img alt="toyota-logo" src="../images/toyota-logo.jpg"></p>
<p>Toyota Corporation is an auto part supplier, a corporate titan. A European subsidiary of the company, Toyota Boshoku Corporation, was targeted by hackers as part of a Business Email Compromise (BEC) scam.
Total financial losses from the BEC scam are reportedly close to $37 million (Â¥4 billion), and the company is now trying to recover this money with the help of law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s get Story started, not so long a ago in 2019, It was as usual work day for Employee at finance and accounting department at Toyota Boshoku Corporation. He started his day by checking emails as we all do. He saw a mail from a person posing to be a Business partner of the Toyota Subsidiary in which he requested funds of $37 Million dollars be sent for payment into specific foreign bank account controlled by the hacker himself. The Employee was more then happy to send the funds because he was excepting this email to come.</p>
<p>So whats the problem you say, here the might have spend months or year studying the workflow of Accounts Department and waited for the right opportunity. Hacker tricked the Employee with fake Email with unrecognizable typo(typing mistake) which seemed that mail came from valid person. </p>
<p>Letâ€™s see if you can spot the difference between: <strong>http://abhhiblogs.com</strong> and <strong>http://abbhiblogs.com</strong>, 95% of you will not be able to seek difference in first look bcoz they seems the same until you pay close attention.</p>
<p>As it was Toyota, $37 Million dollars looked no Suspicious as its their daily transaction, thatâ€™s the reason why Employee didnâ€™t considered to ask his seniors to make sure it was valid id.</p>
<p>We Humans works with full passion when something new is happening but when it comes to our daily job we go on AutoPilot mode. Our human brain tricks us with interesting things and letâ€™s our body do least interesting things.</p>
<p>Humans are the weakest part of Cyber Security Chain, until the work is done by Humans their is always a risk to fail. Humans are tend to make mistakes, this makes humans most Vulnerable in place. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>I hope you liked this story, See you in next blog of the Series. Till then have a good day and babye!!</p>
